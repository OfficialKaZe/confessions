We practically didn't know each other well, but after this, everything changed. From making fun of our friends to getting made fun of ourselves, we laughed through it all and discovered the joy of each other's company.</p>

                        <p class="timeline-text">Doing anchoring with you was incredible (even though I wrote the script LOL). Working with you has always been the best experience. Then came winter break - remember how I did your CS and Physics homework? Then WBMUN happened, and that photo we took is unforgettable. When you trusted me enough to share your breakup with me, saying you thought of me as <span class="highlight">someone you could trust and rely on</span> - that meant everything to me.</p>

Being with someone who cares about you, someone I could share practically anything with, any secret. Our 9-11 sessions, late night talks, 11:11 wishes, and sending snaps all day - this is where things started to change for me, where friendship began blossoming into something deeper.</p>

We were both excited, but I failed completely. I didn't even bother to talk much. Do I regret this? <span class="highlight">More than anything</span>. After camp, I was so disappointed in myself, knowing I could have made your days better but didn't.</p>

                    Ishita, I don't know if there's a perfect way to say this, but I've felt something more than friendship growing in my heart for a while now.<br><br>
                    
                    It's not just because of how beautiful you are (though you absolutely are). It's because of <span class="highlight">how you listen, how you laugh, how you make me feel completely myself</span>.<br><br>
                    
                    You might see me as one among billions, but for me, <span class="highlight">you are one in a billion, one in trillions</span>. You're irreplaceable.<br><br>
                    
                    I think... no, I know... <strong>I love you</strong>. <span class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span><br><br>
                    
                    I'm scared this might change everything between us. But I couldn't keep this inside anymore. Whatever happens, I want you to know that <span class="highlight">you've made my life infinitely better</span> just by being in it.<br><br>
